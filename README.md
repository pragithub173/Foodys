Project for CSP-584 Enterprise Web Application

Foodys is a web application built using Java servlets which allows users to look upon various restaurants across the city and order food from restaurants. The front-end for the application is developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data for the events is batch processed using python requests to Yelp API and storing it in a MySQL database. Reviews for the user experience for the website are stored in a MongoDB database.
